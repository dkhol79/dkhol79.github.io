        <h2><a href="https://fuzionsnz.github.io/GVSU-CIS641-GameSmiths/" target="_blank">My Current Project: Overthrone</a></h2>
        <div class="info-content">
            <p>Imagine a board game that combines cunning strategy, unpredictable twists, and high-stakes competition—all packed into a fast-paced, dynamic experience. This is <strong>Overthrone</strong>, a game where players vie for dominance in a kingdom full of opportunities and treacherous surprises.</p>
            <p>In <strong>Overthrone</strong>, you and up to seven other players are locked in a battle to see who can amass the most points before time runs out. The kingdom's landscape changes with every roll of the dice, throwing everything from point-draining traps to mini-game challenges your way. Every turn is a decision point: will you play it safe or risk it all to turn the game in your favor?</p>
            <p>The brilliance of <strong>Overthrone</strong> lies in its blend of strategy and luck. The board features spaces that can catapult you ahead or drag everyone else down, and as you race to the end of the board, mini-games add another layer of competition, giving players a chance to flip the script.</p>
            <h3>What I’ve Done This Semester:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and built a Game Board System that ensures excitement for the game.</li>
                <li>Developed a Player Turn Logic, enabling smooth transitions between players while enforcing game rules.</li>
                <li>Designed Mini-Games Integration for added excitement and competitive bonus points.</li>
                <li>Created Offline Multiplayer and Lobby Creation for seamless gameplay in an offline environment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Why This Matters:</h3>
            <p><strong>Overthrone</strong> has allowed me to improve critical development skills, from procedural generation and UI/UX design to performance optimization in an offline, multiplayer environment. This project goes beyond just a game. Not only does this showcase my ability to manage complex logic and game mechanics, but it also demonstrates my ability to build user-centered, engaging applications with real-world use cases.</p>
