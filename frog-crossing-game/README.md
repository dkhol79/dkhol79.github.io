# Frog Crossing Game

A simple browser-based game where you control a frog trying to cross a busy road to reach the top safely. Avoid getting hit by moving cars!

## Overview
The Frog Crossing Game is inspired by classic arcade games like Frogger. The player uses arrow keys to move a frog across a road populated with moving cars. The frog animates through a series of sprites (frog1.png to frog7.png) during jumps and can extend its tongue (though this feature isn't yet tied to gameplay mechanics). The goal is to reach the top of the game container without colliding with cars.

## How to Play
- **Controls**: Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to move the frog.
- **Objective**: Guide the frog to the top of the screen.
- **Challenge**: Avoid moving cars on the road.
- **Tongue**: Press a key (to be implemented) to extend the frog's tongue (currently a visual effect).

## Fun Features
- **Frog's tongue** can extend when hit space
- **Fast Cars** when approach slow cars will slow down and keep a distance, so the car line will pile up longer
