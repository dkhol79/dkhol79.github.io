          <h3 class="work-section-title">Overview</h3>
          <p>This project is inspired by the Sinosphere and the world’s forgetfulness about Vietnam. The Sinosphere includes 4 countries, China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam, sharing the East Asian cutural sphere. After many wars and the effects of globalization, Vietnam has taken a step back to deal with potential problems and almost disappeared from the world’s news. Meanwhile, the cultures of China, Japan and Korea are widely known, from food, art, music to manners, traditions and folk tales. And Vietnam was pushed into the group of Southeast Asian countries. Raya and the Last Dragon is the most recent example of this recognition of the pop culture, when the Vietnamese elements are almost invisible that the movie claimed to portray.</p>
