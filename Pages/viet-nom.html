          <h3 class="work-section-title">Overview</h3>
          <p>Viet Nom is a culturally-driven mobile app designed to raise awareness and appreciation for Vietnamese culture through the universal language of food. Unlike traditional recipe apps, Viet Nom weaves rich, authentic stories behind each dish, revealing the cultural, historical, and personal significance of Vietnamese cuisine. From family traditions to regional specialties, every recipe is a narrative experience.</p>
          <p>Refined through real-world feedback from market research and potential users, the app now features an improved user interface, better localization, and community-driven content. Users can not only learn to cook Vietnamese dishes, but also share their own stories, connect with others who share a passion for Vietnamese food, and contribute to a living cultural archive.</p>
          <p>Viet Nom is more than a cookbook;it’s a storytelling platform, a community hub, and a tribute to the heart and heritage of Vietnam, one dish at a time.</p>
